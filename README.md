# Nordic Energy Infrastucture

Nordic Energy connects you digitally directly to the green source of your choice. We buy your electricity from the selected producer and ensure that the corresponding amount of green electricity is produced and fed into the electricity grid. For this we use the most modern blockchain technology, which allows us to avoid unnecessary detours via middlemen and power exchanges. This makes green electricity significantly cheaper, producers generate higher yields, and the electricity grid becomes a little greener with every new Nordic Energy customer.


## We bring significant benefits and innovation: 

Building an new generation energy infrastructure to bridge renewable energy producers’ output and traditional energy grid operators to accelerate a worldwide transition towards a 100% renewable energy future. With renewable energy supply chains, and operational management for energy industry. Supplying energy to homes across the globe, making electricity through generation transporting clean energy and electricity and selling it to the customers.

Nordic Energy (Trading Company) is responsible for the production, purchase, selling electricity and energy certificates via smart contract based blockchain technologies. We use cross-blockchain technologies for a broad range of our businesses, decentralized applications (dApps), supply chains, energy demand and financial applications. Nordic Energy connects energy buyers (end-users and investors) directly with green energy producers and creates an opportunity to purchase electricity upfront at or below market rates. Developing for innovation is a critical element of progress within energy industries, but driving adoption is equally important. We also believe the best innovation and biggest progress comes from opening our doors to the community, which is why we are dedicated to education and open source development within the next energy revolution



## Cross-Platforms & Blockchain Architectures 

Nordic Energy cross-platform architecture is a highly scalable, next generation cross-blockchain platform goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 

The Nordic Energy is in enabling a peer-to-peer energy trading model. The proliferation of Distributed Energy Grids (DERs) or independent renewable energy sources (such as solar panels) that connect to the grid has helped convert energy consumers into producers who are able to sell excess power back to the grid. 

However, that process retains the existing dynamic of the electricity markets, centralizing the task of buying and selling energy under the control of the energy utilities. Nordic Energy´s decentralized network could disrupt that paradigm and enable customers to sell excess power to each other within a given area. 



### PowerChain - Cross-Blockchain Network


#### What is PowerChain?

PowerChain is Peer-to-Peer electricity blockchain trading platform to achieve transparent, stable electricity trading for creating, digital assets and currencies. Our multiple technologies with blockchains, cross-platform technologies and protocols fuels industries work in concert across the energy ecosystem to provide energy in the form and quantity required, with desired reliability at the lowest possible cost. The Nordic Energy ecosystem can be segmented into fuel extraction and refining, fuel peer-to-peer energy trading, delivery, storage, electricity generation, transmission and distribution and electrical consumption by tokenizing energy industry.

- Energy Capacity Market


#### 2. Peer-to-peer Energy Trading Platform

Nordic Energy developing an app that enables energy trading between consumers in a neighborhood within the borough. Nordic Energy, a European startup, is focusing on the energy exchange platform of granular and private data between different parties within the energy market.


## Protocol´s

Smart contracts runs on the Delegated Proof of Stake protocol (DPoS), staking is more energy efficient compared to replace with the actual physical transfer of solar and wind energy, and for now, sit the principles of the energy solutions to better than other renewable energy protocols and using a multiple differential platform. 

Smart Contract aims to provide a novel blockchain solution to meet the speed and scalability required. Nordic Energy PowerChain Is a highly scalable, next generation blockchain platform. Our architecture goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 



## Token Economies

Combined with its efficient and environmentally-friendly consensus, Nordic Energy (NESC) exists as a stable coin that functions as a decentralized finance (DeFi). 

#### Nordic Energy uses a multi-token system: 

NESC - Stable price, perfect for store and transfer value, growing supply
NET - Deflation model, pre-mined, limited supply, growing price
NEST - Security Token for investors and corporation asset backed token
SCT - Smart Charging Token- A decentralized Electric Vehicle Application Platform 
GVT - GreenVenture Token - 

### Nordic Energy tokens usage, utility and values

The utility role of the NET token is a primary consideration in the success of the models that intend to exploit their powers. NET tokens are multi-purpose instruments. Nordic Energy´s utility tokens can be exchanged for goods and services on a certain platforms. Nordic Energy tokens is a unit of value that an Nordic Energy creates to self-govern, our business model, and empower its users to interact with its products, platform while facilitating the distribution and sharing of rewards and benefits to all of it´s stakeholders.


##### The Nordic Energy tokens is used on the Nordic Energy platforms:

The Nordic Energy token will fuel blockchain-based technologies, facilitate access to Nordic Energy ecosystem, allowing global platform interoperability. Nordic Energy token powers all the transactions within the microgrids, solar power plants, wind parks, electric vehicles charging points and power stations etc.

Nordic Energy token is a very efficient payment method and transaction engine of choice. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside these closed environments. Nordic Energy´s own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options, where tokens provide a much lower barrier for processing end-to-end transactions inside a given market.

### Stablecoins

Nordic Energy (NESC) stablecoin uses a stake-distributed Byzantine Fault Tolerance (sdBFT) consensus algorithm. It has a higher operational capacity than other BFT algorithms and allows for stake-based on-chain token holder voting, removing the need for intensive computations. Blocks in NESC are minted rather than mined.

The Nordic Energy PowerChain blockchain network also is decentralized with 10,000 nodes. For every block signatory selection round, 100 nodes out of the 10,000 are selected at random. Subsequently, 1 out of the selected 100 is randomly chosen to sign the block. The remaining 99 nodes become the escort nodes who check the validity of the block. Overall, the process takes roughly 5 seconds to sign the block and 15 seconds to propagate the block to the majority of nodes in the network. 

Escort nodes work in conjunction with specific Masternodes to ensure that ⅔ (common BFT consensus assumption) of the escort nodes produced a valid consensus. Due to this design, NESC can scale effectively as a stake-based on-chain consensus model that does not require intensive energy expenditure. Further, Nordic Energy relies on strong cryptography and uses a unique random number generator to increase its security. 


The NESC token is tethered to the IMF SDR  and is actually used in the real-world economy. Moreover, NESCs can be minted through ownership of the NET token. 

The NESC token has a stable supply and can be used to run an emission center for earning NET by depositing NESC on the blockchain. 

The NESC Stable coin offers the transparent, fast, uncensorable, and energy-efficient consensus that other cryptocurrencies don’t have in combination. Platforms focused on green energy and renewables lack NESC’s stability and security. Proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are energy-intensive and also lack NESC’s stability.
with a real utility as a cryptocurrency.
