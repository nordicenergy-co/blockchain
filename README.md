# Nordic Energy Infrastucture

Nordic Energy cross-platform architecture is a highly scalable, next generation cross-blockchain platform goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 

The Nordic Energy is in enabling a peer-to-peer energy trading model. The proliferation of Distributed Energy Grids (DERs) or independent renewable energy sources (such as solar panels) that connect to the grid has helped convert energy consumers into producers who are able to sell excess power back to the grid. 

However, that process retains the existing dynamic of the electricity markets, centralizing the task of buying and selling energy under the control of the energy utilities. Nordic Energy´s decentralized network could disrupt that paradigm and enable customers to sell excess power to each other within a given area. 



Platform architecture 
````
PowerChain platform architecture is a highly scalable, next generation blockchain platform goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 



PowerChain - Cross-Blockchain Network
````
PowerChain is a direct consumer and digital energy marketplace connects with producers of renewable energies. Without detours and unnecessary additional costs. Our several projects and utilities around the world have already start developing pilots and considering projects to test this possibility.


Decentralized Energy Marketplace:
````
Nordic Energy digital energy platform gives customers direct access to independent green electricity producers. Should it be electricity from the sun, water or wind? Generated regionally or centrally? Only for a short time or permanently? As a customer, you decide yourself.


Peer-to-peer Energy Trading Platform
````
Nordic Energy developing an app that enables energy trading between consumers in a neighborhood within the borough. Nordic Energy, a European startup, is focusing on the energy exchange platform of granular and private data between different parties within the energy market.


Protocol:

Smart contracts runs on the Delegated Proof of Stake protocol (DPoS), staking is more energy efficient compared to replace with the actual physical transfer of solar and wind energy, and for now, sit the principles of the energy solutions to better than other renewable energy protocols and using a multiple differential platform. 

Smart Contract aims to provide a novel blockchain solution to meet the speed and scalability required. Nordic Energy PowerChain Is a highly scalable, next generation blockchain platform. Our architecture goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 



# Token Economies



### Nordic Energy tokens usage, utility and values

The utility role of the NET token is a primary consideration in the success of the models that intend to exploit their powers. NET tokens are multi-purpose instruments. Nordic Energy´s utility tokens can be exchanged for goods and services on a certain platforms. Nordic Energy tokens is a unit of value that an Nordic Energy creates to self-govern, our business model, and empower its users to interact with its products, platform while facilitating the distribution and sharing of rewards and benefits to all of it´s stakeholders.


##### The Nordic Energy tokens is used on the Nordic Energy platforms:

The Nordic Energy token will fuel blockchain-based technologies, facilitate access to Nordic Energy ecosystem, allowing global platform interoperability. Nordic Energy token powers all the transactions within the microgrids, solar power plants, wind parks, electric vehicles charging points and power stations etc.

Nordic Energy token is a very efficient payment method and transaction engine of choice. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside these closed environments. Nordic Energy´s own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options, where tokens provide a much lower barrier for processing end-to-end transactions inside a given market.

#### Stablecoins

Nordic Energy (NESC) stablecoin uses a stake-distributed Byzantine Fault Tolerance (sdBFT) consensus algorithm. It has a higher operational capacity than other BFT algorithms and allows for stake-based on-chain token holder voting, removing the need for intensive computations. Blocks in NESC are minted rather than mined.

The Nordic Energy PowerChain blockchain network also is decentralized with 10,000 nodes. For every block signatory selection round, 100 nodes out of the 10,000 are selected at random. Subsequently, 1 out of the selected 100 is randomly chosen to sign the block. The remaining 99 nodes become the escort nodes who check the validity of the block. Overall, the process takes roughly 5 seconds to sign the block and 15 seconds to propagate the block to the majority of nodes in the network. 

Escort nodes work in conjunction with specific Masternodes to ensure that ⅔ (common BFT consensus assumption) of the escort nodes produced a valid consensus. Due to this design, NESC can scale effectively as a stake-based on-chain consensus model that does not require intensive energy expenditure. Further, Nordic Energy relies on strong cryptography and uses a unique random number generator to increase its security.
